title: "Translingual Document Representations from Discriminative Projections"

abstract: 'Representing documents by vectors that are
independent of language enhances machine
translation and multilingual text categorization.
We use discriminative training to create
a projection of documents from multiple languages
into a single translingual vector space.
We explore two variants to create these projections:
Oriented Principal Component Analysis
(OPCA) and Coupled Probabilistic Latent
Semantic Analysis (CPLSA). Both of these
variants start with a basic model of documents
(PCA and PLSA). Each model is then
made discriminative by encouraging comparable
document pairs to have similar vector
representations. We evaluate these algorithms
on two tasks: parallel document retrieval
for Wikipedia and Europarl documents, and
cross-lingual text classification on Reuters.
The two discriminative variants, OPCA and
CPLSA, significantly outperform their corresponding
baselines. The largest differences in
performance are observed on the task of retrieval
when the documents are only comparable
and not parallel. The OPCA method is
shown to perform best.'
