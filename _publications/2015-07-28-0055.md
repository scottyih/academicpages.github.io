title: "Semantic Parsing via Staged Query Graph Generation: Question Answering with Knowledge Base"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-07-28-0055
abstract: 'We propose a novel semantic parsing
framework for question answering using a
knowledge base. We define a query graph
that resembles subgraphs of the knowledge
base and can be directly mapped to
a logical form. Semantic parsing is reduced
to query graph generation, formulated
as a staged search problem. Unlike
traditional approaches, our method leverages
the knowledge base in an early stage
to prune the search space and thus simplifies
the semantic matching problem. By
applying an advanced entity linking system
and a deep convolutional neural network
model that matches questions and
predicate sequences, our system outperforms
previous methods substantially, and
achieves an F1 measure of 52.5% on the
WEBQUESTIONS dataset.'

We propose a novel semantic parsing
framework for question answering using a
knowledge base. We define a query graph
that resembles subgraphs of the knowledge

a logical form. Semantic parsing is reduced
