title: "Template-Based Information Mining from HTML Documents"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/1997-07-27-0001
abstract: 'Tools for mining information from data can create
added value for the Internet. As the majority of electronic
documents available over the network are in unstructured
textual form, extracting useful information
from a document usually involves information retrieval
techniques or manual processing. This paper presents
a novel approach to mining information from HTML
documents using tree-structured templates. In addition
to syntactic and semantic descriptions, each template
is designed to capture the logical structure of a
class of documents. Experiments have been conducted
to extract FAQ information automatically from over
one hundred HTML documents collected from the
Web. Using two basic templates, the prototype FAQ
Miner has accurately analyzed 65% of the collection of
FAQ documents. With additional processing to handle
“near-pass”es, the success rate is approximately
75%. The preliminary results have demonstrated the
utility of structural templates for mining information
from semi-structured text-based documents.'
