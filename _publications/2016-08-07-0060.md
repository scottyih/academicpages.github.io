title: "Compositional Learning of Embeddings for Relation Paths in Knowledge Bases and Text"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-08-07-0060
abstract: 'Modeling relation paths has offered significant
gains in embedding models for
knowledge base (KB) completion. However,
enumerating paths between two entities
is very expensive, and existing approaches
typically resort to approximation
with a sampled subset. This problem
is particularly acute when text is jointly
modeled with KB relations and used to
provide direct evidence for facts mentioned
in it. In this paper, we propose
the first exact dynamic programming algorithm
which enables efficient incorporation
of all relation paths of bounded
length, while modeling both relation types
and intermediate nodes in the compositional
path representations. We conduct a
theoretical analysis of the efficiency gain
from the approach. Experiments on two
datasets show that it addresses representational
limitations in prior approaches and
improves accuracy in KB completion.'

Modeling relation paths has offered significant
gains in embedding models for
knowledge base (KB) completion. However,
enumerating paths between two entities
is very expensive, and existing approaches
typically resort to approximation

modeled with KB relations and used to
provide direct evidence for facts mentioned

the first exact dynamic programming algorithm
which enables efficient incorporation
of all relation paths of bounded

and intermediate nodes in the compositional
path representations. We conduct a
theoretical analysis of the efficiency gain
