title: "Learning and Inference over Constrained Output"

abstract: 'We study learning structured output in a discriminative
framework where values of the output variables
are estimated by local classifiers. In this
framework, complex dependencies among the output
variables are captured by constraints and dictate
which global labels can be inferred. We compare
two strategies, learning independent classifiers and
inference based training, by observing their behaviors
in different conditions. Experiments and theoretical
justification lead to the conclusion that using
inference based learning is superior when the local
classifiers are difficult to learn but may require
many examples before any discernible difference
can be observed.'

We study learning structured output in a discriminative
framework where values of the output variables
are estimated by local classifiers. In this
framework, complex dependencies among the output
variables are captured by constraints and dictate
which global labels can be inferred. We compare
two strategies, learning independent classifiers and
inference based training, by observing their behaviors
in different conditions. Experiments and theoretical
justification lead to the conclusion that using
inference based learning is superior when the local
classifiers are difficult to learn but may require
many examples before any discernible difference
can be observed.
