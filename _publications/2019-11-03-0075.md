title: "Everything Happens for a Reason: Discovering the Purpose of Actions in Procedural Text"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-11-03-0075
abstract: 'Our goal is to better comprehend procedural text, e.g., a paragraph about photosynthesis, by not only predicting what happens, but
why some actions need to happen before others. Our approach builds on a prior process
comprehension framework for predicting actions’ effects, to also identify subsequent steps
that those effects enable. We present our new
model (XPAD) that biases effect predictions
towards those that (1) explain more of the actions in the paragraph and (2) are more plausible with respect to background knowledge.
We also extend an existing benchmark dataset
for procedural text comprehension, ProPara,
by adding the new task of explaining actions
by predicting their dependencies. We find that
XPAD significantly outperforms prior systems
on this task, while maintaining the performance on the original task in ProPara. The
dataset is available at http://data.allenai.
