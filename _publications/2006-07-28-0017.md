abstract: 'We describe a very simple technique for discriminatively
training a spam filter. Our results on the TREC Enron
spam corpus would have been the best for the Ham at .1%
measure, and second best by the 1-ROCA measure. For the
Mr. X corpus, our 1-ROCA measure was a close second best,
and third best by the Ham at .1% measure. We use a very
simple feature extractor (all words in the subject and headers).
Our learning algorithm is also very simple: gradient
descent of a logistic regression model.'

We describe a very simple technique for discriminatively
training a spam filter. Our results on the TREC Enron
spam corpus would have been the best for the Ham at .1%
measure, and second best by the 1-ROCA measure. For the
Mr. X corpus, our 1-ROCA measure was a close second best,
and third best by the Ham at .1% measure. We use a very
simple feature extractor (all words in the subject and headers).
Our learning algorithm is also very simple: gradient
