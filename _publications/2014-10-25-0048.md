title: "Typed Tensor Decomposition of Knowledge Bases for Relation Extraction"

abstract: 'While relation extraction has traditionally
been viewed as a task relying solely on
textual data, recent work has shown that
by taking as input existing facts in the form
of entity-relation triples from both knowledge
bases and textual data, the performance
of relation extraction can be improved
significantly. Following this new
paradigm, we propose a tensor decomposition
approach for knowledge base embedding
that is highly scalable, and is especially
suitable for relation extraction.
By leveraging relational domain knowledge
about entity type information, our
learning algorithm is significantly faster
than previous approaches and is better
able to discover new relations missing
from the database. In addition, when applied
to a relation extraction task, our approach
alone is comparable to several existing
systems, and improves the weighted
mean average precision of a state-of-theart
method by 10 points when used as a
subcomponent.'
