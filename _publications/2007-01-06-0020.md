title: "Multi-Document Summarization by Maximizing Informative Content-Words"

abstract: 'We show that a simple procedure based on maximizing
the number of informative content-words
can produce some of the best reported results for
multi-document summarization. We first assign a
score to each term in the document cluster, using
only frequency and position information, and then
we find the set of sentences in the document cluster
that maximizes the sum of these scores, subject to
length constraints. Our overall results are the best
reported on the DUC-2004 summarization task for
the ROUGE-1 score, and are the best, but not statistically
significantly different from the best system
in MSE-2005. Our system is also substantially
simpler than the previous best system.'

We show that a simple procedure based on maximizing
the number of informative content-words
can produce some of the best reported results for
multi-document summarization. We first assign a
score to each term in the document cluster, using
only frequency and position information, and then
we find the set of sentences in the document cluster
that maximizes the sum of these scores, subject to
length constraints. Our overall results are the best
reported on the DUC-2004 summarization task for
the ROUGE-1 score, and are the best, but not statistically
