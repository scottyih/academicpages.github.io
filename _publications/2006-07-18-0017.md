abstract: 'For many years, statistical machine translation
relied on generative models to provide
bilingual word alignments. In 2005,
several independent efforts showed that
discriminative models could be used to
enhance or replace the standard generative
approach. Building on this work,
we demonstrate substantial improvement
in word-alignment accuracy, partly though
improved training methods, but predominantly
through selection of more and better
features. Our best model produces the
lowest alignment error rate yet reported on
Canadian Hansards bilingual data.'

For many years, statistical machine translation
relied on generative models to provide
bilingual word alignments. In 2005,
several independent efforts showed that
discriminative models could be used to
enhance or replace the standard generative
approach. Building on this work,
we demonstrate substantial improvement
in word-alignment accuracy, partly though
improved training methods, but predominantly
through selection of more and better
features. Our best model produces the
lowest alignment error rate yet reported on
Canadian Hansards bilingual data.
