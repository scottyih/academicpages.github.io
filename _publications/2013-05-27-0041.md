title: "Combining Heterogeneous Models for Measuring Relational Similarity"

abstract: 'In this work, we study the problem of measuring
relational similarity between two word
pairs (e.g., silverware:fork and clothing:shirt).
Due to the large number of possible relations,
we argue that it is important to combine multiple
models based on heterogeneous information
sources. Our overall system consists of
two novel general-purpose relational similarity
models and three specific word relation
models. When evaluated in the setting of a
recently proposed SemEval-2012 task, our approach
outperforms the previous best system
substantially, achieving a 54.1% relative increase
in Spearman’s rank correlation.'

In this work, we study the problem of measuring
relational similarity between two word
pairs (e.g., silverware:fork and clothing:shirt).
Due to the large number of possible relations,
we argue that it is important to combine multiple
models based on heterogeneous information
sources. Our overall system consists of
two novel general-purpose relational similarity
models and three specific word relation
models. When evaluated in the setting of a
recently proposed SemEval-2012 task, our approach
outperforms the previous best system
substantially, achieving a 54.1% relative increase
in Spearman’s rank correlation.
