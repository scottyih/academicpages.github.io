abstract: 'Most recent question answering (QA) systems query largescale
knowledge bases (KBs) to answer a question, after
parsing and transforming natural language questions to KBsexecutable
forms (e.g., logical forms). As a well-known fact,
KBs are far from complete, so that information required
to answer questions may not always exist in KBs. In this
paper, we develop a new QA system that mines answers
directly from the Web, and meanwhile employs KBs as a
significant auxiliary to further boost the QA performance.
Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, we make the
first attempt to link answer candidates to entities in Freebase,
during answer candidate generation. Several remarkable
advantages follow: (1) Redundancy among answer candidates
is automatically reduced. (2) The types of an answer
candidate can be effortlessly determined by those of its corresponding
entity in Freebase. (3) Capitalizing on the rich
information about entities in Freebase, we can develop semantic
features for each answer candidate after linking them
to Freebase. Particularly, we construct answer-type related
features with two novel probabilistic models, which directly
evaluate the appropriateness of an answer candidate’s types
under a given question. Overall, such semantic features turn
out to play significant roles in determining the true answers
from the large answer candidate pool. The experimental
results show that across two testing datasets, our QA system
achieves an 18% ∼ 54% improvement under F1 metric,
compared with various existing QA systems.'
