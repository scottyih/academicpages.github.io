abstract: 'In conventional supervised training, a model
is trained to fit all the training examples.
However, having a monolithic model may
not always be the best strategy, as examples
could vary widely. In this work, we explore
a different learning protocol that treats
each example as a unique pseudo-task, by
reducing the original learning problem to a
few-shot meta-learning scenario with the help
of a domain-dependent relevance function.
When evaluated on the WikiSQL dataset,
our approach leads to faster convergence and
achieves 1.1%–5.4% absolute accuracy gains
over the non-meta-learning counterparts.'

In conventional supervised training, a model
is trained to fit all the training examples.
However, having a monolithic model may
not always be the best strategy, as examples
could vary widely. In this work, we explore
a different learning protocol that treats
each example as a unique pseudo-task, by
reducing the original learning problem to a
few-shot meta-learning scenario with the help
of a domain-dependent relevance function.
When evaluated on the WikiSQL dataset,
our approach leads to faster convergence and
achieves 1.1%–5.4% absolute accuracy gains
over the non-meta-learning counterparts.
