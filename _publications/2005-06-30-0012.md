abstract: 'We present an approach to semantic role
labeling (SRL) that takes the output of
multiple argument classifiers and combines
them into a coherent predicateargument
output by solving an optimization
problem. The optimization stage,
which is solved via integer linear programming,
takes into account both the recommendation
of the classifiers and a set
of problem specific constraints, and is thus
used both to clean the classification results
and to ensure structural integrity of the final
role labeling. We illustrate a significant
improvement in overall SRL performance
through this inference.'

We present an approach to semantic role
labeling (SRL) that takes the output of
multiple argument classifiers and combines
them into a coherent predicateargument
output by solving an optimization
problem. The optimization stage,
which is solved via integer linear programming,
takes into account both the recommendation
of the classifiers and a set
of problem specific constraints, and is thus
used both to clean the classification results
and to ensure structural integrity of the final
role labeling. We illustrate a significant
improvement in overall SRL performance
through this inference.
