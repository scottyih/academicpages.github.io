title: "Improving Similarity Measures for Short Segments of Text"

permalink: /publication/2007-07-25-0020
abstract: 'In this paper we improve previous work on measuring the
similarity of short segments of text in two ways. First, we introduce
a Web-relevance similarity measure and demonstrate
its effectiveness. This measure extends the Web-kernel similarity
function introduced by Sahami and Heilman (2006)
by using relevance weighted inner-product of term occurrences
rather than TF×IDF. Second, we show that one can
further improve the accuracy of similarity measures by using
a machine learning approach. Our methods outperform other
state-of-the-art methods in a general query suggestion task
for multiple evaluation metrics.'
