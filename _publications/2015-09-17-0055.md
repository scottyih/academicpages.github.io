abstract: 'We describe the WIKIQA dataset, a new
publicly available set of question and sentence
pairs, collected and annotated for research
on open-domain question answering.
Most previous work on answer sentence
selection focuses on a dataset created
using the TREC-QA data, which
includes editor-generated questions and
candidate answer sentences selected by
matching content words in the question.
WIKIQA is constructed using a more natural
process and is more than an order of
magnitude larger than the previous dataset.
In addition, the WIKIQA dataset also includes
questions for which there are no
correct sentences, enabling researchers to
work on answer triggering, a critical component
in any QA system. We compare
several systems on the task of answer sentence
selection on both datasets and also
describe the performance of a system on
the problem of answer triggering using the
WIKIQA dataset.'
