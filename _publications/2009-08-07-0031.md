title: "Learning Term-weighting Functions for Similarity Measures"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-08-07-0031
abstract: 'Measuring the similarity between two
texts is a fundamental problem in many
NLP and IR applications. Among the existing
approaches, the cosine measure of
the term vectors representing the original
texts has been widely used, where the
score of each term is often determined
by a TFIDF formula. Despite its simplicity,
the quality of such cosine similarity
measure is usually domain dependent
and decided by the choice of the termweighting
function. In this paper, we propose
a novel framework that learns the
term-weighting function. Given the labeled
pairs of texts as training data, the
learning procedure tunes the model parameters
by minimizing the specified loss
function of the similarity score. Compared
to traditional TFIDF term-weighting
schemes, our approach shows a significant
improvement on tasks such as judging the
quality of query suggestions and filtering
irrelevant ads for online advertising.'
