title: "The Necessity of Syntactic Parsing for Semantic Role Labeling"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2005-07-30-0014
abstract: 'We provide an experimental study of the role of
syntactic parsing in semantic role labeling. Our
conclusions demonstrate that syntactic parse
information is clearly most relevant in the very
first stage – the pruning stage. In addition, the
quality of the pruning stage cannot be determined
solely based on its recall and precision.
Instead it depends on the characteristics of the
output candidates that make downstream problems
easier or harder. Motivated by this observation,
we suggest an effective and simple
approach of combining different semantic role
labeling systems through joint inference, which
significantly improves the performance.'

We provide an experimental study of the role of
syntactic parsing in semantic role labeling. Our
conclusions demonstrate that syntactic parse
information is clearly most relevant in the very
first stage – the pruning stage. In addition, the
quality of the pruning stage cannot be determined
solely based on its recall and precision.
Instead it depends on the characteristics of the
output candidates that make downstream problems
easier or harder. Motivated by this observation,
we suggest an effective and simple
approach of combining different semantic role
labeling systems through joint inference, which
significantly improves the performance.
