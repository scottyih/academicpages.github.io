abstract: 'Animacy detection is a problem whose solution
has been shown to be beneficial for a
number of syntactic and semantic tasks. We
present a state-of-the-art system for this task
which uses a number of simple classifiers
with heterogeneous data sources in a voting
scheme. We show how this framework can
give us direct insight into the behavior of the
system, allowing us to more easily diagnose
sources of error.'

Animacy detection is a problem whose solution
has been shown to be beneficial for a
number of syntactic and semantic tasks. We
present a state-of-the-art system for this task
which uses a number of simple classifiers
with heterogeneous data sources in a voting
scheme. We show how this framework can
give us direct insight into the behavior of the
system, allowing us to more easily diagnose
sources of error.
