title: "Improving Spam Filtering by Detecting Gray Mail"

abstract: 'We address the problem of gray mail – messages that could
reasonably be considered either spam or good. Email users
often disagree on this mail, presenting serious challenges to
spam filters in both model training and evaluation. In this
paper, we propose four simple methods for detecting gray
mail and compare their performance using recall-precision
curves. Among them, we found that email campaigns that
have messages labeled differently are the most reliable source
for learning a gray mail detector.
Preliminary experiments also show that even when the
gray mail detector is imperfect, a traditional statistical spam
filter can still be improved consistently in different regions
of the ROC curve by incorporating this new information.'

We address the problem of gray mail – messages that could
reasonably be considered either spam or good. Email users
often disagree on this mail, presenting serious challenges to
spam filters in both model training and evaluation. In this
paper, we propose four simple methods for detecting gray
mail and compare their performance using recall-precision
curves. Among them, we found that email campaigns that
have messages labeled differently are the most reliable source
for learning a gray mail detector.
Preliminary experiments also show that even when the
gray mail detector is imperfect, a traditional statistical spam
filter can still be improved consistently in different regions
of the ROC curve by incorporating this new information.
