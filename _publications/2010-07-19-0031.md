title: "Adaptive Near-Duplicate Detection via Similarity Learning"

abstract: 'In this paper, we present a novel near-duplicate document detection
method that can easily be tuned for a particular domain. Our
method represents each document as a real-valued sparse k-gram
vector, where the weights are learned to optimize for a specified
similarity function, such as the cosine similarity or the Jaccard coefficient.
Near-duplicate documents can be reliably detected through
this improved similarity measure. In addition, these vectors can be
mapped to a small number of hash-values as document signatures
through the locality sensitive hashing scheme for efficient similarity
computation. We demonstrate our approach in two target domains:
Web news articles and email messages. Our method is not
only more accurate than the commonly used methods such as Shingles
and I-Match, but also shows consistent improvement across the
domains, which is a desired property lacked by existing methods.'

In this paper, we present a novel near-duplicate document detection
method that can easily be tuned for a particular domain. Our
method represents each document as a real-valued sparse k-gram
vector, where the weights are learned to optimize for a specified
similarity function, such as the cosine similarity or the Jaccard coefficient.
Near-duplicate documents can be reliably detected through
this improved similarity measure. In addition, these vectors can be
mapped to a small number of hash-values as document signatures
through the locality sensitive hashing scheme for efficient similarity
computation. We demonstrate our approach in two target domains:
Web news articles and email messages. Our method is not
only more accurate than the commonly used methods such as Shingles
and I-Match, but also shows consistent improvement across the
domains, which is a desired property lacked by existing methods.
