abstract: 'We present Multi-Relational Latent Semantic
Analysis (MRLSA) which generalizes Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA). MRLSA provides
an elegant approach to combining multiple
relations between words by constructing
a 3-way tensor. Similar to LSA, a lowrank
approximation of the tensor is derived
using a tensor decomposition. Each word in
the vocabulary is thus represented by a vector
in the latent semantic space and each relation
is captured by a latent square matrix.
The degree of two words having a specific
relation can then be measured through simple
linear algebraic operations. We demonstrate
that by integrating multiple relations
from both homogeneous and heterogeneous
information sources, MRLSA achieves stateof-the-art
performance on existing benchmark
datasets for two relations, antonymy and is-a.'

We present Multi-Relational Latent Semantic
Analysis (MRLSA) which generalizes Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA). MRLSA provides
an elegant approach to combining multiple
relations between words by constructing
a 3-way tensor. Similar to LSA, a lowrank
approximation of the tensor is derived
using a tensor decomposition. Each word in
the vocabulary is thus represented by a vector
in the latent semantic space and each relation
is captured by a latent square matrix.
The degree of two words having a specific
relation can then be measured through simple
linear algebraic operations. We demonstrate
that by integrating multiple relations
from both homogeneous and heterogeneous
information sources, MRLSA achieves stateof-the-art
performance on existing benchmark
datasets for two relations, antonymy and is-a.
