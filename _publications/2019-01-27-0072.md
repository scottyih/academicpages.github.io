title: "QuaRel: A Dataset and Models for Answering Questions about Qualitative Relationships"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-01-27-0072
abstract: 'Many natural language questions require recognizing and reasoning
with qualitative relationships (e.g., in science, economics,
and medicine), but are challenging to answer with
corpus-based methods. Qualitative modeling provides tools
that support such reasoning, but the semantic parsing task of
mapping questions into those models has formidable challenges.
We present QUAREL, a dataset of diverse story
questions involving qualitative relationships that characterize
these challenges, and techniques that begin to address
them. The dataset has 2771 questions relating 19 different
types of quantities. For example, “Jenny observes that the
robot vacuum cleaner moves slower on the living room carpet
than on the bedroom carpet. Which carpet has more
friction?” We contribute (1) a simple and flexible conceptual
framework for representing these kinds of questions;
(2) the QUAREL dataset, including logical forms, exemplifying
the parsing challenges; and (3) two novel models for
this task, built as extensions of type-constrained semantic
parsing. The first of these models (called QUASP+) significantly
outperforms off-the-shelf tools on QUAREL. The second
(QUASP+ZERO) demonstrates zero-shot capability, i.e.,
the ability to handle new qualitative relationships without requiring
additional training data, something not possible with
previous models. This work thus makes inroads into answering
complex, qualitative questions that require reasoning, and
scaling to new relationships at low cost. The dataset and models
are available at http://data.allenai.org/quarel.'
