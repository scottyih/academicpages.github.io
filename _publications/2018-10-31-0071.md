title: "Policy Shaping and Generalized Update Equations for Semantic Parsing from Denotations"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-10-31-0071
abstract: 'Semantic parsing from denotations faces two
key challenges in model training: (1) given
only the denotations (e.g., answers), search
for good candidate semantic parses, and (2)
choose the best model update algorithm. We
propose effective and general solutions to each
of them. Using policy shaping, we bias the
search procedure towards semantic parses that
are more compatible to the text, which provide
better supervision signals for training. In
addition, we propose an update equation that
generalizes three different families of learning
algorithms, which enables fast model exploration.
When experimented on a recently proposed
sequential question answering dataset,
our framework leads to a new state-of-the-art
model that outperforms previous work by
5.0% absolute on exact match accuracy.'

Semantic parsing from denotations faces two
