title: "Global Inference for Entity and Relation Identification via a Linear Programming Formulation"

abstract: 'Natural language decisions often involve assigning values to sets of variables, representing
low level decisions and context dependent disambiguation. In most cases
there are complex relationships among these variables representing dependencies
that range from simple statistical correlations to those that are constrained by
deeper structural, relational and semantic properties of the text.
In this work we study a specific instantiation of this problem in the context of
identifying named entities and relations between them in free form text. Given
a collection of discrete random variables representing outcomes of learned local
predictors for entities and relations, we seek an optimal global assignment to the
variables that respects multiple constraints, including constraints on the type of
arguments a relation can take, and the mutual activity of different relations.
We develop a linear programming formulation to address this global inference
problem and evaluate it in the context of simultaneously learning named entities
and relations. We show that global inference improves stand-alone learning; in
addition, our approach allows us to efficiently incorporate expressive domain and
task specific constraints at decision time, resulting, beyond significant improvements
in the accuracy, in “coherent” quality of the inference.'

Natural language decisions often involve assigning values to sets of variables, representing
low level decisions and context dependent disambiguation. In most cases
there are complex relationships among these variables representing dependencies
that range from simple statistical correlations to those that are constrained by
deeper structural, relational and semantic properties of the text.
In this work we study a specific instantiation of this problem in the context of
identifying named entities and relations between them in free form text. Given
a collection of discrete random variables representing outcomes of learned local
