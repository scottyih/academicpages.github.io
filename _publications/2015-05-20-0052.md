title: "Questions vs. Queries in Informational Search Tasks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-05-20-0052
abstract: 'Search systems traditionally require searchers to formulate information
needs as keywords rather than in a more natural form, such
as questions. Recent studies have found that Web search engines
are observing an increase in the fraction of queries phrased as natural
language. As part of building better search engines, it is important
to understand the nature and prevalence of these intentions,
and the impact of this increase on search engine performance. In
this work, we show that while 10.3% of queries issued to a search
engine have direct question intent, only 3.2% of them are formulated
as natural language questions. We investigate whether search
engines perform better when search intent is stated as queries or
questions, and we find that they perform equally well to both.'

Search systems traditionally require searchers to formulate information
needs as keywords rather than in a more natural form, such
as questions. Recent studies have found that Web search engines
are observing an increase in the fraction of queries phrased as natural
language. As part of building better search engines, it is important
to understand the nature and prevalence of these intentions,
and the impact of this increase on search engine performance. In
this work, we show that while 10.3% of queries issued to a search
engine have direct question intent, only 3.2% of them are formulated
as natural language questions. We investigate whether search
engines perform better when search intent is stated as queries or
questions, and we find that they perform equally well to both.
