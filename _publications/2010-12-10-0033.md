abstract: 'Measuring the relevance between the query and paid search ads is an important
problem to ensure the overall positive search experience. In this paper, we study
experimentally the effectiveness of various document similarity models based
solely on the content analysis of the query and ad landing page. Our approaches
focus on two different aspects that aim to improving the document representation:
one produces a better term-weighting function and the other projects the raw
term-vectors to the concept space. Both models are discriminatively trained and
significantly outperform the baseline approach. When used for filtering irrelevant
ads, combining these two models gives the most gain, where the uncaught bad ads
rate has reduced 28.5% when the false-positive rate is 0.1.'

Measuring the relevance between the query and paid search ads is an important
