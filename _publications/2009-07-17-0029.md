title: "Extracting Product Information from Email Receipts Using Markov Logic"

abstract: 'Email receipts (e-receipts) frequently record e-commerce transactions
between users and online retailers, and contain a
wealth of product information. Such information could be
used in a variety of applications if it could be reliably extracted.
However, extracting product information from ereceipts
poses several challenges. For example, the high labor
cost of annotating e-receipts makes traditional supervised
approaches infeasible. E-receipts may also be generated
from a variety of templates, and are usually encoded in
plain text rather than HTML, making it difficult to discover
the regularity of how product information is presented. In
this paper, we present an approach that addresses all these
challenges. Our approach is based on Markov logic, a
language that combines probability and logic. From a corpus
of unlabeled e-receipts, we identify all possible templates
by jointly clustering the e-receipts and the lines in them.
From the non-template portions of e-receipts, we learn patterns
describing how product information is laid out, and
use them to extract the product information. Experiments
on a corpus of real-world e-receipts demonstrate that our
approach performs well. Furthermore, the extracted information
can be reliably used as labeled data to bootstrap a
supervised statistical model, and our experiments show that
such a model is able to extract even more product information.'

Email receipts (e-receipts) frequently record e-commerce transactions
