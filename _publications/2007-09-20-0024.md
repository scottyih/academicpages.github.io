abstract: 'Detection of template and noise blocks in web pages is an
important step in improving the performance of information retrieval
and content extraction. Of the many approaches proposed, most rely on
the assumption of operating within the confines of a single website or
require expensive hand-labeling of relevant and non-relevant blocks for
model induction. This reduces their applicability, since in many practical
scenarios template blocks need to be detected in arbitrary web pages,
with no prior knowledge of the site structure. In this work we propose
to bridge these two approaches by using within-site template discovery
techniques to drive the induction of a site-independent template detector.
Our approach eliminates the need for human annotation and produces
highly effective models. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness
of the proposed methodology for the important applications of keyword
extraction, with relative performance gain as high as 20%.'
