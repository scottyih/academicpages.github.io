title: "Measuring Word Relatedness Using Heterogeneous Vector Space Models"

abstract: 'Noticing that different information sources often
provide complementary coverage of word
sense and meaning, we propose a simple and
yet effective strategy for measuring lexical semantics.
Our model consists of a committee
of vector space models built on a text corpus,
Web search results and thesauruses, and
measures the semantic word relatedness using
the averaged cosine similarity scores. Despite
its simplicity, our system correlates with
human judgements better or similarly compared
to existing methods on several benchmark
datasets, including WordSim353.'

Noticing that different information sources often
provide complementary coverage of word
sense and meaning, we propose a simple and
yet effective strategy for measuring lexical semantics.
Our model consists of a committee
of vector space models built on a text corpus,
Web search results and thesauruses, and
measures the semantic word relatedness using
the averaged cosine similarity scores. Despite
its simplicity, our system correlates with
human judgements better or similarly compared
to existing methods on several benchmark
datasets, including WordSim353.
