abstract: 'We present a novel approach for domain adaptation
based on feature grouping and re-weighting. Our
algorithm operates by creating an ensemble of multiple
classifiers, where each classifier is trained on
one particular feature group. Faced with the distribution
change involved in domain change, different
feature groups exhibit different cross-domain
prediction abilities. Herein, ensemble models provide
us the flexibility of tuning the weights of corresponding
classifiers in order to adapt to the new
domain. Our approach is supported by a solid theoretical
analysis based on the expressiveness of ensemble
classifiers, which allows trading-off errors
across source and target domains. Moreover, experimental
results on sentiment classification and
spam detection show that our approach not only
outperforms the baseline method, but is also superior
to other state-of-the-art methods.'

We present a novel approach for domain adaptation
based on feature grouping and re-weighting. Our
algorithm operates by creating an ensemble of multiple
classifiers, where each classifier is trained on
one particular feature group. Faced with the distribution
change involved in domain change, different
feature groups exhibit different cross-domain
prediction abilities. Herein, ensemble models provide
us the flexibility of tuning the weights of corresponding
classifiers in order to adapt to the new
domain. Our approach is supported by a solid theoretical
analysis based on the expressiveness of ensemble
classifiers, which allows trading-off errors
across source and target domains. Moreover, experimental
results on sentiment classification and
spam detection show that our approach not only
outperforms the baseline method, but is also superior
to other state-of-the-art methods.
