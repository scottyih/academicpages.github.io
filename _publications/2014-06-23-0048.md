abstract: 'This paper tackles the sparsity problem in
estimating phrase translation probabilities
by learning continuous phrase representations,
whose distributed nature enables the
sharing of related phrases in their representations.
A pair of source and target phrases
are projected into continuous-valued vector
representations in a low-dimensional
latent space, where their translation score
is computed by the distance between the
pair in this new space. The projection is
performed by a neural network whose
weights are learned on parallel training
data. Experimental evaluation has been
performed on two WMT translation tasks.
Our best result improves the performance
of a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical
machine translation system trained on
WMT 2012 French-English data by up to
1.3 BLEU points.'

This paper tackles the sparsity problem in
estimating phrase translation probabilities
by learning continuous phrase representations,
whose distributed nature enables the
sharing of related phrases in their representations.
A pair of source and target phrases
are projected into continuous-valued vector
representations in a low-dimensional
latent space, where their translation score
is computed by the distance between the
pair in this new space. The projection is
performed by a neural network whose
weights are learned on parallel training
data. Experimental evaluation has been
performed on two WMT translation tasks.
Our best result improves the performance
of a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical
machine translation system trained on
WMT 2012 French-English data by up to
1.3 BLEU points.
