title: "Semantic Parsing for Single-Relation Question Answering"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2014-06-23-0046
abstract: 'We develop a semantic parsing framework
based on semantic similarity for open domain
question answering (QA). We focus
on single-relation questions and decompose
each question into an entity mention
and a relation pattern. Using convolutional
neural network models, we measure
the similarity of entity mentions with
entities in the knowledge base (KB) and
the similarity of relation patterns and relations
in the KB. We score relational
triples in the KB using these measures
and select the top scoring relational triple
to answer the question. When evaluated
on an open-domain QA task, our method
achieves higher precision across different
recall points compared to the previous approach,
and can improve F1 by 7 points.'

We develop a semantic parsing framework
based on semantic similarity for open domain
question answering (QA). We focus
on single-relation questions and decompose
each question into an entity mention
and a relation pattern. Using convolutional
neural network models, we measure
the similarity of entity mentions with
entities in the knowledge base (KB) and
the similarity of relation patterns and relations
in the KB. We score relational
triples in the KB using these measures
and select the top scoring relational triple
to answer the question. When evaluated
on an open-domain QA task, our method
achieves higher precision across different
recall points compared to the previous approach,
and can improve F1 by 7 points.
