title: "Model-based Interactive Semantic Parsing: A Unified Framework and A Text-to-SQL Case Study"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-11-03-0076
abstract: 'As a promising paradigm, interactive semantic
parsing has shown to improve both semantic
parsing accuracy and user confidence in the results.
In this paper, we propose a new, unified
formulation of the interactive semantic parsing
problem, where the goal is to design a modelbased
intelligent agent. The agent maintains
its own state as the current predicted semantic
parse, decides whether and where human intervention
is needed, and generates a clarification
question in natural language. A key part of the
agent is a world model: it takes a percept (either
an initial question or subsequent feedback
from the user) and transitions to a new state.
We then propose a simple yet remarkably effective
instantiation of our framework, demonstrated
on two text-to-SQL datasets (WikiSQL
and Spider) with different state-of-the-art base
semantic parsers. Compared to an existing interactive
semantic parsing approach that treats
the base parser as a black box, our approach
solicits less user feedback but yields higher
run-time accuracy'

As a promising paradigm, interactive semantic
parsing has shown to improve both semantic
parsing accuracy and user confidence in the results.
In this paper, we propose a new, unified
formulation of the interactive semantic parsing
problem, where the goal is to design a modelbased
intelligent agent. The agent maintains
its own state as the current predicted semantic
parse, decides whether and where human intervention
is needed, and generates a clarification
question in natural language. A key part of the
agent is a world model: it takes a percept (either
an initial question or subsequent feedback
from the user) and transitions to a new state.
We then propose a simple yet remarkably effective
instantiation of our framework, demonstrated
on two text-to-SQL datasets (WikiSQL
and Spider) with different state-of-the-art base
semantic parsers. Compared to an existing interactive
semantic parsing approach that treats
the base parser as a black box, our approach
solicits less user feedback but yields higher
