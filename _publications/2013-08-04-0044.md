title: "Question Answering Using Enhanced Lexical Semantic Models"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2013-08-04-0044
abstract: 'In this paper, we study the answer
sentence selection problem for question
answering. Unlike previous work,
which primarily leverages syntactic analysis
through dependency tree matching, we
focus on improving the performance using
models of lexical semantic resources.
Experiments show that our systems can
be consistently and significantly improved
with rich lexical semantic information, regardless
of the choice of learning algorithms.
When evaluated on a benchmark
dataset, the MAP and MRR scores
are increased by 8 to 10 points, compared
to one of our baseline systems using
only surface-form matching. Moreover,
our best system also outperforms pervious
work that makes use of the dependency
tree structure by a wide margin.'

In this paper, we study the answer
sentence selection problem for question
answering. Unlike previous work,
which primarily leverages syntactic analysis
through dependency tree matching, we
focus on improving the performance using
models of lexical semantic resources.
Experiments show that our systems can
be consistently and significantly improved
with rich lexical semantic information, regardless
of the choice of learning algorithms.
When evaluated on a benchmark
dataset, the MAP and MRR scores
are increased by 8 to 10 points, compared
to one of our baseline systems using
only surface-form matching. Moreover,
our best system also outperforms pervious
work that makes use of the dependency
