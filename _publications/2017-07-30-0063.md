title: "Search-based Neural Structured Learning for Sequential Question Answering"

abstract: 'Recent work in semantic parsing for question answering has focused on long and
	complicated questions, many of which would seem unnatural if asked in a normal
	conversation between two humans. In an effort to explore a conversational QA
	setting, we present a more realistic task: answering sequences of simple but
	inter-related questions. We collect a dataset of 6,066 question sequences that
	inquire about semi-structured tables from Wikipedia, with 17,553
	question-answer pairs in total. To solve this sequential question answering
	task, we propose a novel dynamic neural semantic parsing framework trained
	using a weakly supervised reward-guided search. Our model effectively leverages
	the sequential context to outperform state-of-the-art QA systems that are
	designed to answer highly complex questions.'

Recent work in semantic parsing for question answering has focused on long and
	complicated questions, many of which would seem unnatural if asked in a normal
	conversation between two humans. In an effort to explore a conversational QA
	setting, we present a more realistic task: answering sequences of simple but
	inter-related questions. We collect a dataset of 6,066 question sequences that
	inquire about semi-structured tables from Wikipedia, with 17,553
	question-answer pairs in total. To solve this sequential question answering
	task, we propose a novel dynamic neural semantic parsing framework trained
	using a weakly supervised reward-guided search. Our model effectively leverages
	the sequential context to outperform state-of-the-art QA systems that are
