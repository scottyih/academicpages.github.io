title: "The Value of Semantic Parse Labeling for Knowledge Base Question Answering"

abstract: 'We demonstrate the value of collecting semantic
parse labels for knowledge base
question answering. In particular, (1)
unlike previous studies on small-scale
datasets, we show that learning from labeled
semantic parses significantly improves
overall performance, resulting in
absolute 5 point gain compared to learning
from answers, (2) we show that with an
appropriate user interface, one can obtain
semantic parses with high accuracy and at
a cost comparable or lower than obtaining
just answers, and (3) we have created and
shared the largest semantic-parse labeled
dataset to date in order to advance research
in question answering.'
