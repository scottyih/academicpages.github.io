title: "Raising the Baseline for High-Precision Text Classifiers"

abstract: 'Many important application areas of text classifiers demand
high precision and it is common to compare prospective solutions
to the performance of Naive Bayes. This baseline is
usually easy to improve upon, but in this work we demonstrate
that appropriate document representation can make
outperforming this classifier much more challenging. Most
importantly, we provide a link between Naive Bayes and
the logarithmic opinion pooling of the mixture-of-experts
framework, which dictates a particular type of document
length normalization. Motivated by document-specific feature
selection we propose monotonic constraints on document
term weighting, which is shown as an effective method
of fine-tuning document representation. The discussion is
supported by experiments using three large email corpora
corresponding to the problem of spam detection, where high
precision is of particular importance.'

Many important application areas of text classifiers demand
high precision and it is common to compare prospective solutions
to the performance of Naive Bayes. This baseline is
usually easy to improve upon, but in this work we demonstrate
that appropriate document representation can make
outperforming this classifier much more challenging. Most
importantly, we provide a link between Naive Bayes and
the logarithmic opinion pooling of the mixture-of-experts
framework, which dictates a particular type of document
length normalization. Motivated by document-specific feature
selection we propose monotonic constraints on document
term weighting, which is shown as an effective method
of fine-tuning document representation. The discussion is
supported by experiments using three large email corpora
corresponding to the problem of spam detection, where high
precision is of particular importance.
