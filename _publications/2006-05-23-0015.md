title: "Finding Advertising Keywords on Web Pages"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2006-05-23-0015
abstract: 'A large and growing number of web pages display contex-
tual advertising based on keywords automatically extracted
from the text of the page, and this is a substantial source
of revenue supporting the web today. Despite the impor-
tance of this area, little formal, published research exists.
We describe a system that learns how to extract keywords
from web pages for advertisement targeting. The system
uses a number of features, such as term frequency of each
potential keyword, inverse document frequency, presence in
meta-data, and how often the term occurs in search query
logs. The system is trained with a set of example pages that
have been hand-labeled with “relevant” keywords. Based on
this training, it can then extract new keywords from previ-
ously unseen pages. Accuracy is substantially better than
several baseline systems.'

A large and growing number of web pages display contex-
tual advertising based on keywords automatically extracted
from the text of the page, and this is a substantial source
of revenue supporting the web today. Despite the impor-
tance of this area, little formal, published research exists.
